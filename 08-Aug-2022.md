####
No.175 combine two tables
==
*notice*： left
1. left join will return all rows of left table,so the result may be >= number of records
2. Constraints on the left table will not take effect, but adding conditions to the right table will take effect!


    select  firstName,lastName,city,state
    from Person left join Address 
    on Person.personId = Address.personId

No.181 Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
==
*note*：inner join （ note the where condition）
1. don't use the keyword "distinct" before a.name

    from Employee a join Employee b
    where a.managerId = b.id  and a.salary > b.salary

####
No.182 Duplicate Emails
==
*note*：if we use having without group by, then "having" = "where"
    
group by + having
1. important: Among all the columns after select, columns that do not use aggregate functions must appear after group by 
2. where used before group by; having used after group by


    select email as Email
    from Person
    group by Email
    having Count(Email) > 1
####


####
No.183 Customers Who Never Order
==
*note*：key word: NOT IN
1. if the select result contains "NULL" after not in, not in will fail

    select name as Customers
    from Customers  
    where id not in (select customerId from Orders)
####

####
No.196 Delete Duplicate Emails
==
*考点*：delete a record 
1. usually we use

    delete from [tableName] 
    where [conditions]


    Delete a from Person a , Person b
    where a.email = b.email  and a.id > b.id
####


####
No.197. Rising Temperature
==
*note*：
1. use key word "datediff(date1,date2)" to compare, return the number of days between
2. use "cross join" will return the Cartesian Product


    select a.id 
    from Weather a cross join Weather b
    where datediff(a.recordDate,b.recordDate) =1 
          and a.Temperature > b.Temperature
####

    from Activity 
    group by player_id

####
