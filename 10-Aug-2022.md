No.1068. Product Sales Analysis I
==
*考点*：left join
1. left join is better than inner join 


    select product_name,year,price
    from Sales left join Product
    on Sales.product_id = Product.product_id
####

####
No.1069. Product Sales Analysis II
==
*考点*：Sum()

    select product_id,sum(quantity) as total_quantity
    from Sales
    group by product_id
    
####

####
No.1075. Project Employees I
==
*考点*：Round() + Sum() + Count() + group by

    select project_id,Round(Sum(experience_years)/Count(experience_years),2) as average_years
    from Project join Employee
    on Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
    group by Project.project_id

####

####
No.1076. Project Employees II
==
*考点*：all()
1. wrong answer: order by count() DESC + limit 1 
2. reason: maybe multiple projects have the same number of the most employees
3. how to return the max and without the number 


    select project_id
    from Project
    group by project_id
    having Count(employee_id) >= 
       all(select Count(employee_id) 
           from Project
           group by project_id
        )

No.1082. Sales Analysis I
==
*考点*：group by + having + sum + all
1.solution1

    select seller_id
    from Sales
    group by seller_id
    having (sum(price)) >= all(
            select sum(price)
            from Sales
            group by seller_id
    )
2. solution2 *rank over*


     SELECT seller_id FROM 
     (SELECT seller_id , RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(price) DESC) AS r
     FROM Sales GROUP BY seller_id) s
     WHERE s.r=1;

3. some window functions  execute later than "where,group by, order by"
4. rank & dense_rank & row_number(rank:同样同序,下一个跳过;dense_rank 同样同序,下一个不跳;row_number,同样不同序)
5. difference: "rank" --  order can be like "1/1/3" total number no change ; dense_rank -- order can be "1/1/2" total number will be less
6. rank/dense_rank/row_number() over (partition by [column1] order by [column2] ASC/DESC)

No.1083. Sales Analysis II
==
*note*：Count + if
1. means the buyer who buy S8 can be multiple times and buy iphone 0 times
2. so we need use the count + if


    select buyer_id
    from Sales join Product 
    using(product_id)
    group by buyer_id
    having count(if(product_name = 'S8',1,null)) >=1 
           and count(if(product_name = 'iPhone',1,null)) =0

No.1084. Sales Analysis III
==
*note*：group by + having +min/max to filter the sale_date 
1. important: filter the sale_date only sold by min >= date_min and max<date_max


    select Product.product_id,Product.product_name
    from Sales join Product
    on Sales.product_id = Product.product_id
    group by Sales.product_id
    having min(sale_date)>="2019-01-01" and 
           max(sale_date)<= "2019-03-31"
