####
No.603. Consecutive Available Seats
==
*note*：difficult  inner join + abs()
1. cross join is also useful
2. note the conditions


    select distinct a.seat_id
    from Cinema a inner join Cinema b
    on abs(a.seat_id-b.seat_id)=1 and a.free = 1 and b.free = 1
    order by a.seat_id ASC

why use distinct？
cuz when seat_id = 4 it is adjacent to 3 and 5
