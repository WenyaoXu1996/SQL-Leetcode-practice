No.176. Second Highest Salary
==
*考点*：how to deal with the second,third max/min value - limit + offset
notice: Limit used to limit the number of query result;
Offset  usually paired with limit, means we can skip a certain of number of records 

    select ifnull((select distinct salary 
              from Employee 
              order by salary DESC 
              limit 1,1),null) as SecondHighestSalary

No.177. Nth Highest Salary
==
*考点*： cuz limit cannot calculate , so we need to set N = N-1
notice:cannot use other variable to define N-1
       set must add the ";"

    CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
    BEGIN
      SET N = N-1;
      RETURN (
      select ifnull((select distinct salary 
              from Employee 
              order by salary DESC 
              limit N,1),null) as getNthHighestSalary);

No.512. Game Play Analysis II
==  
*考点*： how to get the rank https://www.cnblogs.com/52xf/p/4209211.html
notice:
1. rank() over - same condition same rank and ranking is discontinuous
   eg：1 1 3 4 5 5 7
2. row_number() over  -1 2 3 4 5
3. dense_rank() over - same condition same rank eg:1 1 2 3 4 5 5 6

note:
when rank used in column name , should add "rank", cuz rank is a function,or response error

    select score,dense_rank() over (order by score DESC ) as 'rank'
    from Scores


####
