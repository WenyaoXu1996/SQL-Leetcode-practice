No.2308. Arrange Table by Gender
==
*考点*: easy/
this method dont need nested query,
Merging of sorting indicators: design index serial number SN * 3 + gender,
where SN is the serial number of each gender sorted by userId,
and gender is the number corresponding to gender (female is 0, other is 1, male is 2).


    select user_id,gender
    from Genders
    order by (rank() over (partition by gender order by user_id ASC))*3 + if(gender='female',0,if(gender = 'other',1,2))

No.2175. The Change in Global Rankings
==
*考点*：  difficult 
how to solve the "signed" problem when calculate the rank diff
1. use the "CAST"  function   -https://blog.csdn.net/qq_21101587/article/details/78642423
2. when calculate the sum of different columns -- sum(col1+col2)


    select team_id,name,
       (CAST(rank1 as signed) - CAST(rank2 as signed)) as rank_diff
    from(
        select t.team_id,name,
           RANK() OVER(order by points DESC,name) as rank1,
           RANK() OVER(order by points + points_change DESC,name) as rank2
        from TeamPoints t JOIN PointsChange p 
        on p.team_id = t.team_id
    ) temp

No.2292. Products With Three or More Orders in Two Consecutive Years
==
*考点*：
first get the temporary table of  product ordered three or more times
then get the distinct product_id in consecutive years

notice: how to use with cte
with cte (Common Table Expression)  as (
  subquery
) as(
  new subquery
)
later we can use the columns in the CTE


    with cte as (
    select product_id,Count(product_id),year (purchase_date) as year
    from Orders
    group by product_id,year
    having Count(product_id)>=3)

    select distinct c1.product_id
    from cte c1,cte c2
    where c1.product_id = c2.product_id and abs(c2.year - c1.year) = 1

No.2159. Order Two Columns Independently
==
*考点*：
#first get rank of two columns 
#then use inner join select these two columns 


    with a1 as (
    select first_col, row_number () over (order by first_col ASC) as rk
    from Data),
    a2 as (
    select second_col, row_number () over (order by second_col DESC) as rk
    from Data)
    select a1.first_col,a2.second_col
    from a1 join a2
    using(rk)

*考点*：

    select b.bus_id, count(t.passenger_id) passengers_cnt
    from Buses b 
    left join (
         select p.passenger_id, min(b.arrival_time) bus_arrival_time
         from Passengers p left join Buses b 
         on b.arrival_time >= p.arrival_time
         group by p.passenger_id
    ) t 
    on b.arrival_time = t.bus_arrival_time
    group by b.bus_id
    order by b.bus_id;

    from Orders as a left join Orders as b
    on a.customer_id =b.customer_id  and a.order_type <>b.order_type
    where b.order_type is null or b.order_type=1


    select * from Orders
    where not (customer_id in 
    (
    select distinct customer_id from Orders where order_type = 0
    ) and order_type = 1)
